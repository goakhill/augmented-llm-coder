# augmented-llm-coder
 A low-complexity LLM augmenting approach geared towards making a better Java coding assistant
 Provided are the jupyter notebooks used for the research as well as the CodeNet Project benchmarking problem descriptions and the labelled results.
## HOW TO
To run the RAG framework, clone the repository and go through the Loading.ipnyb file to create the embeddings vectorstore. You will need Ollama with Gemma 7B instruct downloaded as well as the Langchain libraries. 
Once the vectorestore is created, you can run any of the QA notebooks to invoke the models responses to the Java problems.
