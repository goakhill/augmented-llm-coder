 Problem Statement Sig has built his own keyboard. Designed for ultimate simplicity, this keyboard only has  3  keys on it: the  0  key, the  1  key and the backspace key. 
 To begin with, he is using a plain text editor with this keyboard. This editor always displays one string (possibly empty). Just after the editor is launched, this string is empty. When each key on the keyboard is pressed, the following changes occur to the string: 
 
 The  0  key: a letter  0  will be inserted to the right of the string. 
 The  1  key: a letter  1  will be inserted to the right of the string. 
 The backspace key: if the string is empty, nothing happens. Otherwise, the rightmost letter of the string is deleted. 
 
 Sig has launched the editor, and pressed these keys several times. You are given a string  s , which is a record of his keystrokes in order. In this string, the letter  0  stands for the  0  key, the letter  1  stands for the  1  key and the letter  B  stands for the backspace key. What string is displayed in the editor now?

 Structured Programming 
 
In programming languages like C/C++, a goto statement provides an unconditional jump from the ""goto"" to a labeled statement. For example, a statement ""goto CHECK_NUM;"" is executed, control of the program jumps to CHECK_NUM. Using these constructs, you can implement, for example, loops.
 
 
Note that use of goto statement is highly discouraged, because it is difficult to trace the control flow of a program which includes goto.
 
 
Write a program which does precisely the same thing as the following program (this example is wrtten in C++). Let's try to write the program without goto statements.
 
 
void call(int n){
  int i = 1;
 CHECK_NUM:
  int x = i;
  if ( x % 3 == 0 ){
    cout << "" "" << i;
    goto END_CHECK_NUM;

 Problem Statement You have  N  apples, called Apple  1 , Apple  2 , Apple  3 , ..., Apple  N . The  flavor  of Apple  i  is  L+i-1 , which can be negative. 
 You can make an apple pie using one or more of the apples. The flavor of the apple pie will be the sum of the flavors of the apples used. 
 You planned to make an apple pie using all of the apples, but being hungry tempts you to eat one of them, which can no longer be used to make the apple pie. 
 You want to make an apple pie that is as similar as possible to the one that you planned to make. Thus, you will choose the apple to eat so that the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining  N-1  apples will have the smallest possible absolute difference from the flavor of the apple pie made of all the  N  apples. 
 Find the flavor of the apple pie made of the remaining  N-1  apples when you choose the apple to eat as above. 
 We can prove that this value is uniquely determined.

114,p02420.html,"Shuffle 
 
  Your task is to shuffle a deck of  n  cards, each of which is marked by a alphabetical letter.
 
 
  A single shuffle action takes out  h  cards from the bottom of the deck and moves them to the top of the deck.
 
 
  The deck of cards is represented by a string as follows.
 
 
abcdeefab
 
 
  The first character and the last character correspond to the card located at the bottom of the deck and the card on the top of the deck respectively.
 
 
  For example, a shuffle with  h  = 4 to the above deck, moves the first 4 characters ""abcd"" to the end of the remaining characters ""eefab"", and generates the following deck:
 
 
eefababcd
 
 
  You can repeat such shuffle operations.
 
 
  Write a program which reads a deck (a string) and a sequence of  h , and prints the final state (a string). 
 
 Input 
 
  The input consists of multiple datasets. Each dataset is given in the following format:
 
 
A string which represents a deck
The number of shuffle  m 
 h 1 
 h 2

There are  n  processes in a queue. Each process has name i  and time i .  The round-robin scheduling handles the processes in order. A round-robin scheduler gives each process a  quantum  (a time slot) and interrupts the process if it is not completed by then.

Reverse Polish notation is a notation where every operator follows all of its operands. For example, an expression (1+2)*(5+4) in the conventional Polish notation can be represented as 1 2 + 5 4 + * in the Reverse Polish notation. One of advantages of the Reverse Polish notation is that it is parenthesis-free.
 
 
Write a program which reads an expression in the Reverse Polish notation and prints the computational result.
 
 
An expression in the Reverse Polish notation is calculated using a stack. To evaluate the expression, the program should read symbols in order. If the symbol is an operand, the corresponding value should be pushed into the stack. On the other hand, if the symbols is an operator, the program should pop two elements from the stack, perform the corresponding operations, then push the result in to the stack. The program should repeat this operations.
 
 Input 
 
An expression is given in a line. Two consequtive symbols (operand or operator) are separated by a space character.
 
 
You can assume that +, - and * are given as the operator and an operand is a positive integer less than 10 6

Print the computational result in a line.
 
 Constraints 
 
2 ≤ the number of operands in the expression ≤ 100 
1 ≤ the number of operators in the expression ≤ 99

 Problem Statement Takahashi loves numbers divisible by  2 . 
 You are given a positive integer  N . Among the integers between  1  and  N  (inclusive), find the one that can be divisible by  2  for the most number of times. The solution is always unique. 
 Here, the number of times an integer can be divisible by  2 , is how many times the integer can be divided by  2  without remainder. 
 For example, 
 
 6  can be divided by  2  once:  6  ->  3 . 
 8  can be divided by  2  three times:  8  ->  4  ->  2  ->  1 .

 Drawing Lots 
 
Let's play Amidakuji. 
 
 
In the following example, there are five vertical lines and four horizontal lines. The horizontal lines can intersect (jump across) the vertical lines.
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the starting points (top of the figure), numbers are assigned to vertical lines in ascending order from left to right. At the first step, 2 and 4 are swaped by the first horizontal line which connects second and fourth vertical lines (we call this operation (2, 4)). Likewise, we perform (3, 5), (1, 2) and (3, 4), then obtain ""4 1 2 5 3"" in the bottom.
 
 
Your task is to write a program which reads the number of vertical lines  w  and configurations of horizontal lines and prints the final state of the Amidakuji. In the starting pints, numbers 1, 2, 3, ...,  w  are assigne to the vertical lines from left to right.
 
 Input 
 
 w
